08:30 < amiller> does this mimble wimble thing really work
08:30 < amiller> i really wish we could talk about these things in terms of zk proofs rather than signatures with related keys
08:30 -!- Chris_Stewart_5 [~Chris_Ste@unaffiliated/chris-stewart-5/x-3612383] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
08:30 < andytoshi> amiller: i think it works. agreed, would be easier to talk about in terms of zk proofs (tho this would require reframing some things)
08:32 < amiller> can you summarize the scheme with your privacy improvement inlined?
08:32 < andytoshi> i think so .. one sec
08:33 < andytoshi> so to start, every utxo has a CT pedersen commitment associated to it, vH + rG, and `r` is the secret blinding factor that only the owner knows (nobody else, no auditors, etc)
08:34 -!- ThomasV [~ThomasV@unaffiliated/thomasv] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
08:34 < andytoshi> if i send you money, i produce a half-transaction that has everything except your outputs in it (so one change and some inputs), and i also give you the (r, v) pair such that (output commit - input commits = vH + rG.
08:35 -!- JackH [~Jack@79-73-188-45.dynamic.dsl.as9105.com] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
08:35 -!- thepumpernickle1 [~duphass@65.78.54.2] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
08:35 < andytoshi> you, the recipient, then add your own outputs so that (output commits - input commits = kG) for some k that you know. split k into k = k1 + k2. then publish a signature with k1G as well as k2
08:36 -!- thepumpernickle1 [~duphass@65.78.54.2] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
08:36 < andytoshi> so k1G has a sig which is a zk proof that you know k1, and k2 is a full-knowledge proof that you know k2, and this proves that the excess kG does not have any H component, which in turn proves that the whole transaction adds up
08:37 < andytoshi> does this make sense so far? can you see a clean way to discribe this whole tx in terms of zk proofs (i do not, it really seems like this interaction is necessary but only the participants can be usre that this interaction happened..)
08:37 -!- oneeman [~oneeman@ip254-177-15-186.ct.co.cr] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
08:38 < amiller> hm
08:38 < andytoshi> i guess, i give *you* a full-knowledge proof that i know the blinding key for (change minus inputs). then you produce a zk proof that you know the blinding key for the entire (outputs - inputs)
08:39 < andytoshi> "full-knowledge proof" is a term i just made up for my giving you the values .. i can stop using this if you want
08:39 < amiller> seems ok, i also don't know better notation
08:39 < amiller> in general there are these sort of multi-prover zk proofs and i have no notation for htem
08:39 < amiller> like i prove one thing, you adapt that proof plus add more to it to make a related proof but you didn't know the whole witness
08:40 < andytoshi> yeah
08:40 < andytoshi> so it's really not publicly verifiable that i did a key handoff here, only the recipient can verify this. what *is* publicly verifiable is that no coins were created or destroyed certainly
08:40 < amiller> how is this different than CT?
08:40 < andytoshi> but there's also something stronger being shown, if i keep my own blinding factors secret then everyone knows there's no theft
08:40 < amiller> i guess going in i thought this was going to be comparable to ringCT
08:40 < andytoshi> no, ringCT is actually orthogonal (though technically i have zero idea how to combine these)
08:41 < andytoshi> CT just uses the blinding factors as blinding factors. this scheme uses the blinding factors for authentication. that's the moral difference
08:41 < andytoshi> (it then uses this fact to get OWAS and massive pruning while still allowing full verification)
08:41 < amiller> how does it give any better pruning than CT
08:42 < andytoshi> CT doesn't give any pruning at all, you've gotta keep every output and every rangeproof around if you want to be able to reverify the chain
08:42 < kanzure> andytoshi: you should still look at http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2016-july-bitcoin-developers-miners-meeting/dan-boneh/
08:42 < andytoshi> this literally lets you delete every spent output
08:42 -!- JackH [~Jack@79-73-188-45.dynamic.dsl.as9105.com] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
08:42 < andytoshi> thanks kanzure, it's open, i will
08:43 < amiller> "reverify the chain" ok
08:43 < andytoshi> amiller: ...and if you give the chain to somebody, without any spent outputs or any input refs even, they can still verify that along the entire history no theft or inflation happened
08:43 < andytoshi> (assuming everyone kept their keys secret, "theft" means something technical here..)
08:44 < amiller> this seems like an interesting and relevant security goal but i don't understand it clearly yet, we can talk about it independently of the scheme though
08:44 < amiller> so like, a new node that wants to start mining and verify the whole chain
08:44 < amiller> without just relying on SPV security
08:44 < andytoshi> yeah, i'd like to talk about this. i'm trying to understand the security model here.
08:44 < andytoshi> right
08:44 < amiller> it's safe to ignore some information that was originally included?
08:44 < andytoshi> yes. what this new node cares about is knowing the current chainstate (utxo set)
08:45 < andytoshi> suppose the node *does not* care how this utxoset came to be, only that somehow the coins were always passed along honestly
08:45 < amiller> and i can verify that this utxo set doesn't reflect any invalid transitions like a block that ignores some previous transactions
08:45 < andytoshi> exactly
08:46 < andytoshi> there exists a path of handoffs (where "handoff" is something we'd have to describe more precisely, but it's done by one of the transactions i described above) from coinbase inputs to the current utxos
08:47 < instagibbs> If you don't validate all of the blocks' contents, it's possible there is an entirely different utxo set that also seems valid. Peers can tell you about these alternative sets of utxo though.
08:48 < andytoshi> instagibbs: what do you mean?
08:48 < instagibbs> (thought we discussed this already but I'll rexplain)
08:48 < andytoshi> if you mean peers can give you different merkle paths for the same utxos, that doesn't give a different utxoset
08:48 < andytoshi> that just attaches the utxoset to the blockchain in a different way
08:48 < instagibbs> or different utxos
08:49 < instagibbs> like, imagine complete disjoint post-genesis histories
08:49 < andytoshi> kk pls explain
08:49 < amiller> i feel like there's something implicit missing, like we're implicitly assuming SPV already or osmething
08:49 < amiller> like i think there's something lurking here that makes the efficiency claim vs CT not actually present
08:49 < andytoshi> instagibbs: this scheme does not allow that, all the coinbase inputs are explicit
08:49 < andytoshi> amiller: this has completely different goals than CT
08:49 < andytoshi> CT was just about hiding amounts, this is about collapsing history
08:50 < instagibbs> andytoshi, sorry can you explain why that would stop that
08:50 < amiller> what is collapsing history? so far everything you described sounds like CT
08:50 < instagibbs> merkle trees don't prove anything about not having two different spends of the same outputs
08:50 < andytoshi> instagibbs: the blockchain defines a single set of inputs. the inputs are part of the history. therefore you cannot have disjoint histories
08:50 < amiller> the outputs are represented as commitments, the sender/receiver together make a transaction or pair of half-transactions that spend some old outputs and create so new outputs
08:50 < andytoshi> instagibbs: no, but the algebra prevents that (unless the "same output" appeared twice)
08:51 < andytoshi> amiller: yes, i haven't gotten to the collapsing history yet
08:51 < andytoshi> but nor have i made any claims of space savings yet
08:51 < instagibbs> genesis block makes 1 blinded output, following block has 2 transactions(ignore the fact that we can decduce double-spending from pure numbers here))
08:51 < andytoshi> i'm just trying to reframe this specific part in a way that you like, because it's critical to everything else
08:51 < amiller> ok, i think i understand the signature scheme well enough
08:52 -!- skyraider [uid41097@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-bknnswquleyykzrf] has quit [Quit: Connection closed for inactivity]
08:52 < instagibbs> one transaction has 2 outputs, the other has 1, let's say. So they're unique in blinding factors and so on.
08:52 < andytoshi> amiller: kk, so the next part is OWAS, which is pretty straightforward, you can just put transactions inputs and outputs together, then the sum of all outputs minus all inputs will be the sum of all these excess k*G values
08:52 -!- NewLiberty [~NewLibert@2602:306:b8e0:8160:95f0:e47a:e341:4811] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
08:52 < instagibbs> So I reveal one history to you, and hide the other. The math will work out.
08:52 < andytoshi> amiller: so you keep both k1G + sig, and you add the explcit k2s, and this is OWAS
08:53 < instagibbs> I have no idea what this means for the security model in reality
08:53 < andytoshi> instagibbs: lemme think about this, this seems very serious
08:54 < instagibbs> I mean it's the same problem we have in Bitcoin... but with our scheme we get strong guarantees knowing that it is at least *a* valid non-inflationary history
08:54 < instagibbs> our meaning wimble
08:55 < andytoshi> yeah, sure, but we may have consensus disagreement between peers
08:55 < instagibbs> but peers may be on different histories, on same chain header. Peers can tell each other. I'm not sure how to converge
08:55 < andytoshi> (which might be recoverable, maybe inputs need to have explicit merkle paths and this does it)

08:55 < andytoshi> no, that's not sufficient..
08:55 < instagibbs> yeah I thought about that too, then discounted it, but can't immediately recall
08:56 < kanzure> andytoshi: re: OWAS things, the dan boneh transcript covers this in some gorey detail, but also it was covered near the bottom of https://bitcoincore.org/logs/2016-05-zurich-meeting-notes.html

08:56 < kanzure> starting near the section called "Schnorr stuff and signature aggregation" (or just search for "OWAS")
08:58 < instagibbs> so you'd need to figure out where the first violation of the "only one spend of one output" rule is broken, invalidate back to that block, and sync from there, or something.
08:58 < andytoshi> instagibbs: you don't need to multispend any outputs to do this tho
08:58 < instagibbs> oh hm?
08:58 < andytoshi> instagibbs: you create three outputs with commitments C1, C2, C1 + C2. when IBDing you reveal C1 and C2 to some peers, C1 + C2 to others
08:59 < instagibbs> err right
08:59 < andytoshi> now you've IBD'd peers in a way that they disagree on the utxo set-
08:59 < instagibbs> well there are inputs being spent twice, in general
08:59 < instagibbs> but yes we care about new outputs matching up
08:59 < andytoshi> peers who were online at the time would detect this, but that's tendermint security model
08:59 < andytoshi> instagibbs: what do you mean by inputs being spent twice in general?
09:00 < instagibbs> I agree with what you're saying, it's not impt
09:00 < instagibbs> Nodes would have to reject a chain once they discover the utxo set conflicts with another one
09:00 < andytoshi> instagibbs: ok, maybe the outputs need to be in a merkle sum tree
09:00 < andytoshi> so you can't do this C1, C2, C1 + C2 trick
09:02 < instagibbs> Well, there is already DoS vector of simply being fed bad utxo set
09:02 < andytoshi> yes that's fine, there are ways around that (basically asking peers for a quorum on what the utxos in each block actually ought to be)
09:02 < instagibbs> At least with this attack it would require miners making "legitimate" parallel histories
09:03 < instagibbs> which can/will invalidate huge swaths of blocks if caught
09:03 < andytoshi> yes, that's worse, because then it's not detectable
09:03 < andytoshi> but using a merkle sum tree prevents it i thin
09:03 -!- zooko` [~user@2601:281:8000:8387:60e9:2e7:ca6e:7b6a] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
09:05 < andytoshi> oh, no, you can fool a merkle sum tree by putting negative outputs in. you just never reveal these to anyone
09:05 < instagibbs> I was hoping peer gossip would be just as effective as spreading the header chain, but now not sure at all
09:06 < andytoshi> in practice it might be
09:06 < andytoshi> but this is a weird security model
09:06 -!- zooko [~user@73.95.137.19] has quit [Ping timeout: 276 seconds]
09:07 < andytoshi> you can amplify from peer gossip to SPV by having miners commit to the current utxoset in every block
09:08 < andytoshi> so you have full security in knowing that no invalid transactions have occured, but only SPV security that your history is the one that everyone else is using
09:08 < andytoshi> (which actually, might be exactly what you want, the blockheaders define the "history that everyone else is using" anyway..)
09:09 < instagibbs> Hmm, yes I was hoping the gossip would be more holistic, but I think it's looking more fraud-proofy considering peers wouldn't even care about bad branches
09:10 -!- fractex [~fractex@2602:306:cc08:25c0:bb7c:8a18:e13b:9c2d] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
09:12 < andytoshi> i don't like gossip or fraud proofs, both of these can be censored from a peer who is surrounded during IBD (and maybe the peer doesn't know to ask for it later so the effect is permanent)
09:12 -!- newbie [~kvirc@80.203.141.26] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
09:12 < instagibbs> Yes
09:13 < instagibbs> So it sort of reminds me of a rolling utxo commitment
09:13 < instagibbs> but you must assume miners all start from beginning
09:13 < kanzure> without gossip how are you doing initial block download?
09:14 < instagibbs> kanzure, that's what I mean, the gossip isn't as useful as it is for finding the best chain
09:15 < instagibbs> but the gossip for wimble will never prove to the user they are on the right chain
09:15 < kanzure> is this concern about lack of diff and lack of knowing where the problem is in the data set?
09:15 < instagibbs> s/right/valid/
09:16 < andytoshi> kanzure: no the problem is that there can be multiple valid histories associated to the same blockheader chain
09:16 < instagibbs> It's the lack of knowing if you're on a valid chain/utxo set.
09:17 < andytoshi> so you can make a "randomized merkle-sum tree" which avoids this problem i think
09:17 < andytoshi> each internal node commits to the sum H(L)L + H(R)R where L, R are its two child nodes
09:18 < andytoshi> now if you have C1, C2, C1 + C2 in the same merkle tree there is no way to come up with extra branches that will hide this fact
09:19 < andytoshi> ..has anyone heard of this construction before? i just made it up..
09:20 < iddo> if you have utxoset in every block then you can "collapse" the history by trimming everything except the last k blocks (say k=1000), are you guys suggesting a way to collapse the history that gives better security guarantees than this simple approach?
09:20 < kanzure> iddo: http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/bitcoin/mimblewimble.txt
09:20 < andytoshi> iddo: yes, certainly, in that case you can literally make up the entire history before the last k blocks
09:21 < andytoshi> or make up no history, just say "the chainstate was this back then, trust me"

09:22 < iddo> what's the security guarantees that you want to have?
09:22 < instagibbs> andytoshi, the attacker could put C1, C2 in block 2, and C1+C2 in block 3?
09:22 < instagibbs> Originally I described the attack as odd/even blocks, to make it clear they could be anywhere
09:23 < instagibbs> iddo, we would like full node security without downloading the entire chain :)

09:26 < andytoshi> instagibbs: well you can always make the root of the tree have as children the "real" root as well as the previous block's root, so they are all connected
09:28 < andytoshi> but i'm unsure now what this randomized merkle sum tree actually gets you though, i'm confused again
09:29  * andytoshi goes for a run
09:29 < instagibbs> yeah good idea, cheers
09:29 < iddo> with the simple approach you'd get say k=1000 PoW confirmations that the utxoset is in consensus, you claim that you can verify the history from genesis after trimming the history?
09:30 < andytoshi> iddo: yes, kanzure posted a link
09:30 < iddo> btw you can do probabilistic proof that the utxoset is verified from genesis, but it isn't practical
09:31 < kanzure> instagibbs: for full node security without downloading and verifying the entire chain, you should probably work backwards from full security and then figure out what you can add to that scenario, until you work backwards to something that roughly approximates the set of features you prefer a full node to have.
09:32 < kanzure> and ideally without saying "turn the entire system into a giant zk-snark and just query a bunch of small proofs and let the proofs battle each other for supremacy"

10:03 < andytoshi> instagibbs: ok, so forget all that merkle sum stuff. the only thing an attacker can do with your attack is split consensus; he can't steal coins or inflate or anything (he can only split his own coins, since he'd have to rangeproof the split). so add a commit to the utxoset in each block, now such a consensus split is trivially detectable (and the longest-chain rule can take care of it)
10:04 < andytoshi> so you have full security knowing the utxoset up to how the coins are split up (and their age), which means knowing the utxoset up to ownership, and SPV security of the exact split (i.e. whether you are on the consensus history)
10:04 -!- ThomasV [~ThomasV@unaffiliated/thomasv] has quit [Ping timeout: 260 seconds]
10:04 < andytoshi> but you already only have SPV security that you're on the consensus history, that's more or less what SPV security means
10:08 < gmaxwell> it is a little obnoxious that a summary-verifier could end up on a history that had temporary theft but which was made whole at the end, while a full verifier would reject that history.
10:08 < gmaxwell> you could say that the full verifier should reorg to accept it too, since the end result is the same-- but that only makes sense if the only enforced rules are the rules enforcable by summary verification.
10:11 -!- MaxSan_ [~one@185.103.96.151] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
10:12 < andytoshi> gmaxwell: well remember that the blockheaders untimately do commit to everything
10:12 < iddo> not clear if you're trimming data forever, or just having a method to provide SPV proofs, if you trim forever then you're not protected against reversal of history of length greater than where you trimmed?
10:12 < andytoshi> so if there really are alternate histories like this they will have alternate blockchains
10:12 < instagibbs> I'm thinking along the lines of allowing multiple histories, even invalid transactions. If you had a conflicting utxo tie-breaking rule, nodes could converge by just sharing what they know, much like sharing block headers today..
10:12 -!- ennui [~user@unaffiliated/ennui] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
10:12 < andytoshi> iddo: correct, you're basically screwed if you reorg past where you trimmed (you'll have to find the data somewhere)
10:12 < andytoshi> iddo: but the security here is much stronger than SPV
10:13 < instagibbs> given a proper utxo set you know there's no inflation, and you can be told about better histories by a single honest peer.
10:13 < andytoshi> instagibbs: that seems very hard to do, which history is "better"?
10:13 < instagibbs> yes, that's the nut to crack
10:14 < andytoshi> if i have ten utxos on one history, and ten on the other, that are simply split up differently (and i'm not limited to ten, and i'm not limited to having the same number either), neither is any better
10:14 < andytoshi> and in general detecting this even involves solving subset-sum
10:14 < andytoshi> err, that's not true, you'll notice when consensus splits
10:14 < instagibbs> well you can make it arbitrarily better, like say first utxo in a conflicting history in the block
10:14 < instagibbs> (probably not good idea but still)
10:14 < andytoshi> i think that creates the ability to retroactively invalidate blocks
10:15 < instagibbs> invalidates utxo state, right, and no clear way of updating, and now that i think of it, doesnt work
10:15 < andytoshi> i really think just committing to the utxoset in each block is the solution here, then differing utxo splits are detected by looking at the block headers
10:15 < iddo> so i still don't see how you get better security than just utxoset in every block and trim old history, is the security just with regard to better anonymity?
10:15 < andytoshi> iddo: have yiou read the paper?
10:15 < instagibbs> iddo, we are discussing the paper
10:16 < iddo> no sorry :(
10:17 < instagibbs> ok, tiebreaking rule doesnt work because there's no way to compute which utxos "correspond" to others
10:21 < instagibbs> so the added value here is with utxo commitment on top you are SPV in that you're trusting the miners to not commit to a utxo set in an invalid chain with multiple histories.
10:21 < instagibbs> each history can not inflate or steal either way
10:22 < andytoshi> instagibbs: correct
10:22 < andytoshi> you're trusting the miners not to break consensus
10:22 < andytoshi> but you are already trusting them not to do that

17:06 < kanzure> your summary is good and useful, and having a pile of research questions is also useful
17:07 < kanzure> jrayhawk: for transaction fees in a low-subsidy environment, yes there are grinding attacks and vulnerabilities. and transaction fee volatility does not help the situation.

17:09 < kanzure> fee delay doesn't entirely solve the problem because miners still have an incentive to grind backwards to remine a high-fee transaction

17:12 < andytoshi> kanzure: hmm, i don't think i can rewrite this as a question because i don't know the right question, my big problem is that i don't know how to think about this really. maybe i just need to let it settle in my head
17:13 < jrayhawk> Yeah, I can see temporal diffusion of reward being useful; full nodes can track and project reward sizes and split up (or advise SPV clients to split up) large transactions into components broadcast over time as confirmations come in to make all the incentives safer, and miners can pay the reward forward by the same means.
17:14 < jrayhawk> I'm actually kinda curious if there's any robust way of solving https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4vupa6/p2shinfo_shows_movement_out_of_multisig_wallets/d61qyaj though
17:15 < kanzure> sounds like an "incentive-related transaction delay", e.g. coin throughput is limited based on available hashrate. if there's a bunch of dark hashrate then you could maybe posit that hashrate would light up to try to grab the fee in nearby blocks if it is evenly distributed among the next n blocks but this infringes on reason to bother with transaction prioritization by fee.
17:16 < kanzure> .. and is already close enough to "light up and grind some blocks to get the last fee" anyway.
17:16 < kanzure> http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/security-of-diminishing-block-subsidy/
17:20 < kanzure> oh that link is not quite the one i thought it was. hrm.
17:20 < jrayhawk> The BFX thing seems trivially unresolvable to me without an extra identity or trust network; there's an incentive for a person spending fast (faster than the mining reward) to bribe miners to reorg to doublespend, and there's no good way to track individual people to dodge consequences of that (other than, I guess, 50% transaction fees).

18:07 < bsm1175321> Just noticed this: http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/02/26/how-to-implement-secure-bitcoin-vaults/
18:07 < bsm1175321> Sorry, but this seems utterly silly.  If you thought 6 confirmations were too long, now we're going to 24 hours and soon T+3.  This is the way back to the cave.
18:07 < bsm1175321> Did I miss something with this?
18:11 < gmaxwell> you missed that it would be used for coins intentionally held in cold storage.
18:13 < bsm1175321> I could achieve the same thing, and not need to bother everyone else with reversibility, by having a better cold storage key security mechanism, no?
18:14 -!- cyphase [~cyphase@unaffiliated/cyphase] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
18:14 < bsm1175321> What if I'm a merchant who receives a payment 3 (6-)confirmations down the line from the original thief?  Do I deserve to get screwed over?
18:16 < TD-Linux> cold storage would normally fund hot storage. otherwise it's not very cold
18:18 < gmaxwell> bsm1175321: what, ?! you've misunderstood it.
18:18 < bsm1175321> They could have achieved that by asking BitGo to only cosign the transaction after a 24-hour waiting period, and calling the relevant principals.
18:18 < gmaxwell> bsm1175321: the merchants couldn't be paid with those coins after they've been released... the merchant wouldn't see a payment until they're released.
18:19 < gmaxwell> bsm1175321: still requires a TTP who could screw up, e.g. by making it easy to release the funds.
18:19 -!- cyphase [~cyphase@unaffiliated/cyphase] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
18:19 < bsm1175321> But isn't that what they have with BitGo?
18:20 < gmaxwell> "still requires" was referring to your "asking BitGo".
18:21 < bsm1175321> So seems to me they screwed up their relationship with BitGo, and didn't successfully implement what Emin calls Covenenants/Vaults...
18:22 < bsm1175321> It seems to me that the (now public) information that certain addresses/utxo's are being used as cold wallets is incredibly useful to an attacker.

23:17 < kanzure> jrayhawk: one idea i have heard tonight is the idea that if you take too much fee in a low-subsidy environment, others will be incentivized to grind on that block until someone chooses a rational amount of transaction fees. and every miner should by default engage in that behavior, to redistribute fee more correctly, even in the presence of high transaction fee volatility. and then other tricks can be used like exponential fee decay ...
23:18 < kanzure> ... over the next n blocks or something.
