### Collection of important documents and links related to the development of GRIN. 

> On August 2nd, 2016, Tom Elvis Jedusor published a file via a hidden server hosted on Tor. The document, called Mimblewimble, describes a blockchain that uses a completely different transactional construction method than Bitcoin, and supports confidential transactions, while allowing full validation of the blockchain, without the need for new users to view the full transaction history.

> Subsequently, Andrew Poelstra added some content, and achieved the Mimblewimble protocol.
On October 20, 2016, Ignotus Peverell announced Grin and released the first version of Mimblewimble, written in Rust language.

> Grin is not controlled by any company or foundation, nor does it conduct fundraising activities such as an ICO or any kind of token sales, instead, Grin relies on donations. Therefore, Grin does not have an official team, but a group of like-minded people work hard for the projects they love.

> Respected developers who develop Grin can join a technical committee responsible for governance. But the final decision is still in the hands of the community.

*Anyone who has contributed to Grin can be a member of the Grin team because Grin does not belong to anyone.*
