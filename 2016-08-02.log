00:23 < kanzure> some other interesting thing from dan:
00:23 < kanzure> https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14/technical-sessions/presentation/michalevsky
00:23 < kanzure> "We show that the MEMS gyroscopes found on modern smart phones are sufficiently sensitive to measure acoustic signals in the vicinity of the phone. The resulting signals contain only very low-frequency information (<200Hz). Nevertheless we show, using signal processing and machine learning, that this information is sufficient to identify speaker information and even parse speech. Since iOS and Android require no special permissions to ...
00:23 < kanzure> ... access the gyro, our results show that apps and active web content that cannot access the microphone can nevertheless eavesdrop on speech in the vicinity of the phone."

00:29 < nsh> if you had access to 20 gyros in one room, you could achieve roughly linear increase in resolution
00:30 < nsh> nontrivial dsp problem though

02:45 < Alanius> nsh: you mean the Joux protocol?
02:46 < nsh> it's something pairing based that Boneh alluded to in the recent dev meeting
02:46 < nsh> ( http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2016-july-bitcoin-developers-miners-meeting/dan-boneh/ )
02:47 < Alanius> so: Alice, Bob and Charlie all publish their contributions: g^a, g^b, g^c and keep a, b, c secret
02:47  * nsh nods
02:47 < Alanius> Alice is able to compute the pairing of Bob and Charlie's contributions: e(g^b, g^c) = e(g,g)^(bc)
02:47 < Alanius> and she then raises that to her own secret value a
02:48 < Alanius> essentially the same process happens for Bob and Charlie
02:48 < nsh> oh, interesting
02:48 < nsh> why won't it scale beyond three?
02:48 < nsh> oh right, need more rounds
02:49 < nsh> if you higher order pairings you could do more parties. hmmm
02:49 < Alanius> well, maybe there exists a trilinear map (tripling?) e that can take g^b, g^c, g^d to e(g,g,g)^(bcd)
02:49  * nsh nods
02:50 < nsh> that's what i should have said, higher order linear maps
02:50 < Alanius> finding such a map would make you famous :)
02:50 < nsh> heh heh :)
02:50 < nsh> my main problem in life is beyond too (in)famous :)
02:51 < Alanius> I think fhe actually implies multilinear maps, but the problem there is efficiency (or lack thereof)
02:52 < nsh> right
02:55 < nsh> it might be possibl--- no, that's a terrible idea. hmmm, maybe it's not
02:57 < nsh> (it might be possible to hedge up DHKE products while incidentally transacting then use an accumulator structure to launder them periodically. giving folk access to precached shared secrets if they need them for a channel)
02:57 < nsh> i guess that already happens in elements alpha
02:58 < nsh> sans the laundering

03:01 -!- aalex__ [~aalex@64.187.177.58] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
03:03 < nsh> so with confidential transactions you do non-interactive DHKE with each transaction, and this can be used to reclaim space in the range proof for a secure cryptographic messaging channel. this means anyone that's transacted has created a potentially-reusable symmetric cryptographic session
03:04 < nsh> which is kinda handy i guess. trying to think of other ways that might happen if we moved to something like BLS sigs
03:05 < nsh> and more speculatively whether you could aggregate the key exchange across a chain of transactions

07:11 < andytoshi> kanzure: i downloaded that onion link and rehosted it at https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/mimblewimble.txt in case you want to rehost as well. idk if it's correct but it sounds legit. the first bit of it (the OWAS stuff) i had actually come up with a slightly more space-wasting version on my own not too long ago, so this isn't a total crank at least
07:11 < andytoshi> is this channel mirrored on slack somewhere?
07:11 -!- edvorg [~edvorg@113.172.154.4] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
07:12 < pigeons> yeah i think i saw a read only room on slack the one time i went to the "bitcoin core" slack
07:12 < pigeons> linked to this room
07:12 < andytoshi> kk. i posted that and immediately a slack link-expander hit my server. (i don't mind obvs for a public room, but it startled me)
07:13 < andytoshi> the claim of this paper is that he can structure transactions (a) with full OWAS, basically every block is a coinjoin of all its transactions, and (b) such that you can do full validation of the chain without needing all the historic data, basically just the utxoset and a (relatively) small bit of each block
07:14 < andytoshi> with just discrete logs
07:15 < andytoshi> i already have a slight improvement i think ... when i was looking into this on my own, i found i could do payment channels .. this jedusor guy seems to just drop all script ability entirely and says "future research" but i think i have a way to do checklocktimeverify without breaking any of his crypto
07:16 < andytoshi> (basically with the output you sign "after block X, this output should be replaced with this other one, then you do some sort of proof that the other one commits to the same value. just signing with the difference is sufficient)
07:18 < andytoshi> then i _think_ you can do multisig in the standard schnorr way, though it's a PITA, you've gotta interactively create the rangeproof and stuff (need to look into this more)

09:41 < andytoshi> that would entail breaking discrete log

09:46 < kanzure> andytoshi: did you look at this one? http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2016-july-bitcoin-developers-miners-meeting/dan-boneh/
09:53 < nsh> andytoshi, how is the rangeproof validity is maintained in aggregation?
09:53 < nsh> how are the ... validities
09:53 < andytoshi> nsh: every unspent output has a rangeproof. every input is explicit
09:54 < andytoshi> who cares what the actual history is, that's all you need to know to be assured there is no inflation
09:54 < nsh> right
09:54 < nsh> you just need to retain the utxo proofs
09:54 < nsh> gotta be some way this is sneaky, otherwise it's too good to be true...
09:55 < andytoshi> hah, yeah, i know the feeling
09:55 < nsh> :)
09:55 < andytoshi> so one thing instagibbs pointed out to me offline is that you can lie to new users about the -age- of unspent outputs
09:55 < nsh> hm, right
09:56 < andytoshi> like you create an output, spend it, later create the same output again. everyone who was online the whole time knows about the new output. but you tell a new user about the -old- one and not the -new- one
09:56 < andytoshi> but it's hard for me to understand whether or not this actually matters..
09:56 < nsh> but you could commit OOB to some timestamping ledger when you first got an output
09:56 < nsh> and prove it later, i think
09:56 < andytoshi> yeah, sure, or even a recent blockhash
09:56  * nsh nods
09:56 < nsh> biggest loss is script
09:56 < andytoshi> this would make you more vulnerable to reorgs. would need to think about the tradeoffs here, it seems like this whole scheme is pretty fragile in the case of deep reorgs
09:57 < nsh> oh yeah
09:57 < instagibbs> I think it's interesting in any case that you get a rolling UTXO commitment essentially
09:57 < nsh> i think there would have to be some conservative retention window
09:57 < nsh> but we have equivalent stuff in bitcoin already for ageing block subsidy, etc.
09:57 < andytoshi> yeah nsh like a few thousand blocks maybe. hard to say. on bitcoin we've never had more than 30 block reorg, on testnet we've had over 1000 a few times
09:57 < nsh> so it'll not be any more complex than that really i think
09:58 < nsh> reorg distribution is a function of PoW and game theory and economics and other stuff not treated
09:59 -!- aalex__ [~aalex@64.187.177.58] has quit [Ping timeout: 244 seconds]
10:00 < nsh> what about range proof reclamation, is that still possible?
10:00 < nsh> (reuse for messaging/data)
10:01 < andytoshi> yeah. it's hard to think about .. in bitcoin a 100 block reorg is about twice as hard as a 50 block one, and causes roughly twice the damage. but if there was a cliff where basically the whole system broke, that changes the incentives
10:01  * nsh nods
10:01 < andytoshi> nsh: still possible but you've gotta keep it forever cuz most nodes won't
10:01 < nsh> aye, sure
10:01 < andytoshi> in elements we use it just for ephemeral information anyway..

10:02 -!- Mazz_ [~mazznilla@unaffiliated/mazznilla] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
10:03 < nsh> but this means you could build a twister-like ephemeral microblogging / IM into a client for essentially free
10:03 < andytoshi> yep
10:03 < nsh> and highly censorship resistant :)
10:03 < nsh> well, depending on hashpower
10:03 < nsh> so that's neat :)
10:04 < nsh> (and dependent on enough nodes for accessibility saturation)
10:04 < andytoshi> well, publishing stuff is hard .. if you reveal the encryption key that exposes the value
10:04 < nsh> you can do it for the cost of fees
10:05 < nsh> with 0 valued transactions, no?
10:05 < andytoshi> ah, yes
10:05 < andytoshi> or 1 valued transactions, he gives some reason there not to allow 0-valued outputs
10:05 -!- ThomasV [~ThomasV@unaffiliated/thomasv] has quit [Ping timeout: 264 seconds]
10:05 < nsh> right
10:06 < andytoshi> (because they can be made to sum to 0, and be hidden from some users, and you've got a consensus failure.)
10:06 < nsh> hmm
10:06 < nsh> how do you know that/when you have the whole utxo collected from the network?
10:07 < andytoshi> nsh: when everything adds up to 0, you've got everything
10:07 < nsh> relative to the most recent block?
10:07 < nsh> ok
10:07 < andytoshi> (but if some subset could add up to 0 itself, which can only be done with specially crafted 0-value outputs, then this actually wouldn't do it)
10:08 < andytoshi> nsh: so i think how this would work is that you do this magic compression thing to get all the blocks up to $tip - 5000 or something, and make sure the utxoset you're given at that block adds up to 0
10:08 < andytoshi> then for the latest 5000 blocks, you download the entire blocks and play it forward
10:08  * nsh nods
10:08 < nsh> there's probably room for some spv trade-off on that parameter too
10:09 < nsh> or light node
10:09 < nsh> (at least somewhat better than the degree to which people trust bc.i, etc.)
10:09 < andytoshi> i think the tradeoff is about reorg resistance
10:10 < andytoshi> and about how much room you have to be lied to about coin age
10:10  * nsh nods
10:11 < nsh> not clear to me yet why only 0 transactions can be split into positive/negative and not any other sum
10:12 < andytoshi> because only 0-valued outputs can be negated and still be rangeproofed to be in [0, 2^64]
10:12 < nsh> oh right
10:12 < nsh> heh
10:12 -!- c0rw1n is now known as GreenBat
10:12 < nsh> that's very quirky
10:12 -!- GreenBat is now known as c0rw1n
10:12 < nsh> i guess maths can be quirky
10:14 < nsh> interesting q: '2. We require user to check all k*G values, when in fact all that is needed is that their sum is of the form k*G. Instead of using signatures is there another proof of discrete logarithm that could be combined?
10:15 < nsh> oh, the badUTXOs DoS is nontrivial too
10:16 -!- zooko [~user@c-73-217-16-2.hsd1.co.comcast.net] has joined #bitcoin-wizards
10:16 < andytoshi> mm, that one might actually be trivial, if everyone uses "round numbers" as anchor points you can ask other nodes which utxos in a given block were legit
10:16 < nsh> any node can poison the set and it's computationally hard to know which tx broke the sum
10:16 < nsh> hmm
10:16 < nsh> not sure i follow
10:16 < andytoshi> like nodes would have the real blockhash then a "pruned blockhash" representing the block as it stood at height 20000 or something
10:17 < andytoshi> and if a node is suspicious, it can compare its "pruned blockhash" with that of other nodes
10:17 < nsh> hmmm
10:18 < andytoshi> (this was the first idea i came up with, maybe it's broken, or maybe there's some better way)
10:18 < nsh> sounds like it would work, but unsure of interaction complexity vs. penetration of malicious nodes

10:24 < kanzure> for some reason i sort of assumed you were working on aggregatable signatures for confidential transactions
10:24 < andytoshi> no kidding
10:24 < andytoshi> no, til a week or so ago i thought that'd require pairing .. i maybe talked about it, but i always thought it would require pairing so the result wasn't very interesting to me
10:27 < nsh> so what has replaced the role of pairing here, exactly?
10:27 < nsh> it's just pederson to the hilt i guess
10:27 < andytoshi> hah, yeah, "pedersen to the hilt"

14:44 < andytoshi> re mimblewimble, it's not quite OWAS because it's possible to separate out the transaction .. you have these k*G values which represent the excess, so you just need to find subsets of inputs and outputs that sum to each one
14:45 < andytoshi> this is the subset-sum problem which is NP-hard in general, but might not be for many specific cases
14:46 < andytoshi> having said that, the knowers of specific k*G values can interact to combine their transactions, which would make this much harder. an implementation of mimblewimble should maybe have network messages for doing this
14:46 < andytoshi> err, not combine transactions, just combine their k*G values. the actual transactions don't need to be involved at all

15:02 < andytoshi> ah, there's a simple fix, publish k1*G and k2, sign with k1*G but make the transaction excess be (k1 + k2)*G
15:02 < andytoshi> and when combining transactions all the k2's just get added together
